Pentest Scripts &amp; Stuff

###USB_Drop_Callback.py
###INTRODUCTION
This script is used during USB drop social engineering assessments.  
Once the script is comipled and ran it will collect the following:  
  - Time of Execution
  - Name of File Clicked
  - Username of the Logged in User
  - FQDN of the machine is ran on

###COMPILING
The script can be compiled using PyInstaller, using the following syntax:  
```python
  python pyinstaller -w --onefile USB_Drop_Callback.py
```
The '-w' flag prevents a cmd window from opening upon execution.
###USAGE
The compiled executable is then placed on the USBs to be dropped.  Other measures can be taken to make the files look more authentic, such as:
  - Change file name to something such as "Client Name - Salary Trends.xlsx," etc. and add multiple spaces after the 'false extension" to hide the ".exe."
  - Use a program such as Resource Hacker to change the icon of the application to match the extension type.
  
A web server must be enabled to accept the GET requests.  Requests include all collected information as base64 encoded.
